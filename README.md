= Beerlover

A proposition of achievement for Coderwall.
The script count how many github project under the beerware license you have.
It basically check for a /LICENSE/ file, and check if it is the beerware license.

== Usage

A test server run at http://beerware-detector.herokuapp.com/ just add a
username after:
   http://beerware-detector.herokuapp.com/Mayeutik

and it will return:
   {"count":3}

== Todo

A lot of things, this version is only a first try for the scripts, I exept to make it a lot more better. Any feedback is welcome :)
